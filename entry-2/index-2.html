        <br>
   
        <p>A website for food logging, designed to help me keep track of what I eat, 
        understand the ingredients I'm consuming, and get meal ideas + inspiration.
        The site will explore means of health and self-care while balancing college life.</p>
         <br>
        <p>While balancing work and school I’ve found myself often skipping out on meals or
        eating processed/junk foods that are quick to make. I also find myself overbuying 
        or underbuying ingredients and having trouble budgeting and choosing what to eat. 
         I wanted to make a “diary” that not only pushes me to eat cleaner but to also 
         help me organize my relationship with food and finances. </p>
