                Creating a food budget is important because it helps you plan your meals, 
                avoid overspending, and make smarter choices at the grocery store. 
                When you know what you can afford, you’re more likely to buy what you truly need, 
                reduce waste, and still eat balanced, nutritious meals. A food budget keeps you 
                organized, saves money, and makes mealtime less stressful.
