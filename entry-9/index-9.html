            <p>
               While balancing work and school I’ve found myself 
               often skipping out on meals or eating processedo r junk 
               foods that are quick to make. I also find myself 
               overbuying or underbuying ingredients and having trouble 
               budgeting and choosing what to eat. I wanted to make a “diary” 
               that not only pushes me to eat cleaner but to also help me 
               organize my relationship with food and finances.
